    Synthesizer Program
    By: Tyler Ruff
    INFO:
        This program was created based on a backbone application created by the Youtuber: G223 Productions (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjGTOnMHKk73DC9BTsf2c9Q)
        However, this final version is wildy different from his tutorial version (as you can see by examining his final product).
        This program uses LWJGL (https://www.lwjgl.org/) as a dependency for audio synthesis.
